<<<--------------
Summary
------------->>>


To install perform the following commands


cd ~
mkdir 
pimotion
cd 
pimotion
mkdir images

sudo apt-get install python-imaging

sudo apt-get install python-picamera
wget https://github.com/JacquesInnocent/picamera/blob/picamera/picamera-motion.py
wget https://github.com/JacquesInnocent/picamera/blob/picamera/Readme.txt
 ./picamera-motion.py


Note: you may have to install other libraries and make sure your 
raspberry pi is running a current updated version of raspbian.


Tuning
------
To change motion detection settings edit the pimotion.py file using nano
it is recommended you make a backup copy just in case.

from a logged in putty ssh or console terminal session edit using nano.  You
can also use IDLE if desired.
 
  
That's it .

Please note this code is pretty basic but a good learning tool if
you need to implement a simple python only 
motion detection application
using the picamera python libraries.
